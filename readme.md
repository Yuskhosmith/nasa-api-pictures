This project collects data from NASA's APOD API (Astronomy Picture of the Day). You're limited to 30 requests per hour and 50 requests per day. I have 5 requests per loads, so you can only check 6 times per hour and 10 times per day.

You can add to Favorite and still have access to those whenever you visit the page on the same device as it uses Local Storage to store these data.

- [x] Imperative vs Declarative Programmin
    - Imperative Programming is exactly what I have done here, writing my script for every move the user might make, making sure everything is ordered and step by step. The problem with this is that, the more the complexity, the difficult it becomes to see relationships.
    - Declarative Programming is a paradigm that describes what the program does, without explicitly specifying its control flow. For example, in React, Life is easier than this (Vanilla JS) 😂.
